# `htop` commmand 

 - When you run `htop` in your terminal, it launches an interactive process viewer that displays a list of processes currently running on your system.
 - It presents information such as CPU and memory usage, process IDs, user names, and more in a color-coded and easy-to-read format. Additionally, htop allows you to interactively manage processes, such as killing or renicing them, directly from the terminal interface.

Note : The -y flag in the apt install command stands for "yes." When you use the -y flag with apt install, it instructs apt to automatically answer "yes" to any prompts or confirmation messages that may appear during the installation process
