# Linux-Bash-Scripting
- Bash scripting in Linux refers to the creation and execution of scripts written in the Bash (Bourne Again SHell) programming language.
- Bash is the default shell for most Linux distributions and is widely used for automating tasks and executing commands in the Linux environment.

## Real world Scenario 
- Imagine you are a system administrator responsible for managing a network of servers. Regular backups of important data are crucial to ensure data integrity and disaster recovery. However, manually performing backups on multiple servers can be time-consuming and error-prone. This is where Bash scripting comes into play.
- You need to determine what data needs to be backed up, where it's located, and how frequently backups should occur.
- Using Bash scripting, you can create a script that automates the backup process. The script may include commands to archive specific directories or files, compress them, and then transfer the backup to a remote server or storage device.
