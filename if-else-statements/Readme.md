# If-Statements

In Bash, you can use the if statement to conditionally execute commands based on the evaluation of a test expression. The basic syntax of the if statement in Bash is as follows.

```bash
if [ condition ]; then
    # commands to execute if condition is true
else
    # commands to execute if condition is false
fi
```
