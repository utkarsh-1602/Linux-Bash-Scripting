# `ls` command

The `ls` command in Unix-like operating systems is used to list directory contents. It can be used with various options to display the contents in different formats and with different levels of detail. 

```bash
ls
```

## Here are some common usage examples:

1. To display detailed information about files and directories, including permissions, owner, group, size, and modification time, use the -l option:

```bash
ls -l 
```


2. To show all files, including hidden files (those whose names start with a dot), use the -a option:

```bash
ls -a 
```

3. To display file sizes in a human-readable format (e.g., KB, MB, GB), use the -h option along with -l

```bash
ls -lh
```
